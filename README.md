# Fixed Effects Regression Analysis Project

## Objective
This project aims to explore the determinants of log hourly wage among sex workers using a robust statistical approach. It aims to identify factors influencing wage variations of sex workers.

## Model Types
- **Pooled OLS Regression**: This model serves as the baseline, analyzing the overall relationship between variables without considering individual-specific effects.
- **Fixed Effects Regression**: This model accounts for individual heterogeneity by controlling for variables that do not change over time within individuals, providing insights into within-individual variations.
- **Demeaned OLS Regression**: By demeaning the data to remove individual-specific effects, this model offers another perspective on the relationship between the variables and the log hourly wage.
